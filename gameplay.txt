The goal of the game is to have the most 4-card sets at the end of the game. 


Gameplay is as follows: 

1) A total of 5 cards are dealt to each player. 

2) The dealer is randomly chosen, and the player following the dealer in the game's order takes the first turn. 

3) The first player selects an opponent and asks him/her for a card. The requesting player must have at-least one card of the same rank that he/she is requesting. 

4) the request recipient must hand over all cards of that rank to the requester. If the request recipient has no cards of that rank, he/she tells the requestor to "go fish". If the requestor is told to "go fish", he/she then selects a card from the top of the deck. If the card selected is of the same rank as the card initially requested, the requestor displays the card to his/her opponents, and takes another turn. 

5) When a player has 4 cards of the same rank, he/she places the 4 cards face-up on the table. 

6) The game ends when all cards have been placed face-up on the table. The player with the most face-up sets is the winner.
